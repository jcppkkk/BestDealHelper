## Comprehensive Feature Overview

### 1. Payback Rate Ratio Display üíπ
Introduces a **normalized** Payback Rate, with higher values indicating shorter payback periods after purchases. This helps you identify the most profitable items quickly.
*Normalization adjusts each Payback Rate to a percentage that reflects its efficiency compared to the average, making comparisons easier.

### 2. Automated Sorting for Buildings and Upgrades (Toggle Feature)
Automatically ranks buildings and upgrades by their Payback Rate, guiding you towards the most beneficial purchases.

### 3. Waiting Time Indication ‚è≥
Presents a waiting time indicator for each item, giving you transparency on the expected delays.

### 4. Tier Upgrade Forecasting
Estimates the benefits of purchasing multiple buildings up to the next upgrade tier, which can often result in a more favorable Payback Rate. The "(to X)" notation helps you understand how many buildings are needed to reach the optimal Payback Rate, factoring in tier upgrades.

### 5. Rainbow Color Coding for Optimal Intermediate Purchases
Highlights alternative, more affordable purchases in rainbow colors that can accelerate your progress towards the best long-term investments.

### 6. Wizard Tower Exclusion Option (Toggle Feature)
For advanced players aiming to maintain specific spell intervals, this option allows for the exclusion of wizard towers from Payback Rate calculations, preventing them from skewing your strategic overview.
